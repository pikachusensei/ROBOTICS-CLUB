        <h4>ABOUT US</h4>
        <p class="a">We are an organisation at <span>NIT BHOPAL</span> which help students to build robots
        by providing them resources and knowledge.
        The concept and creation of autonomously operating machines dates back a long time, 
        but credible research into the functionality and potential uses of robots did not 
        grow substantially until the 20th century. And today, robotics is a rapidly growing
        field, as we continue to research, design and build new robots that serve various
        practical purposes including domestic, commercial and military. Having said that, 
        the Robotics Club of <SPAN>NIT BHOPAL</SPAN> strives to stimulate interest in robotics among the 
        students of the institute. Besides making a serious endeavour to spread knowledge on 
        Robotics and its diverse applications, it also stands by the subtle acronym of 
        TEAM - 'Together Everyone Achieves More'. But over the years it has diversified.
        We firmly believe in working in a planned, organized and disciplined manner that helps us in 
        risk free management. The proceedings of the clubs are all pre-planned and run smoothly according
        to the constitution. Well defined goals, an organized and disciplined work structure and
        motivated members are the features of the club, to mention a few, that have helped the 
        club to grow to a level where we see it now. The club today is an active platform for 
        students to display and develop their practical machine building skills and knowledge. 
        Any company interested to adopt any of the Robotics devices, we would be more than happy 
        to adopt or transfer the technology.
